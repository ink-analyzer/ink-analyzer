# ink! Language Server

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for the [ink!](https://use.ink/) smart contract programming language.

It implements the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and acts as a backend that provides language support features like diagnostic errors, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content to IDEs, code editors and other development tools.

It uses the [semantic analyzer](/crates/analyzer) as the engine for providing ink! language support features by:
- translating LSP requests into semantic analyzer interface calls.
- translating semantic analysis results into corresponding LSP types.

It additionally uses rust-analyzer's [lsp-server](https://docs.rs/lsp-server/latest/lsp_server/) crate to handle LSP protocol handshaking and parsing messages and the [lsp-types](https://docs.rs/lsp-types/latest/lsp_types/) crate for LSP type definitions.

It can be reused by multiple IDEs, code editors and other development tools that support LSP servers including [Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, Acme, Lapce, Eclipse and many more](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).
